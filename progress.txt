# Development Progress Log

## 2026-01-25 - globalChains Schema Implementation

### Completed
- Created `convex/schemas/platform/globalChain.ts` with the globalChains table schema
- Created `convex/schemas/platform/index.ts` to export platform schemas
- Updated `convex/schema.ts` to import and include the platform schema

### Files Created/Modified
- `convex/schemas/platform/globalChain.ts` (new)
- `convex/schemas/platform/index.ts` (new)
- `convex/schema.ts` (modified - added platformSchema import and spread)
- `docs/prd/prd.json` (updated - marked globalChains schema and platform index as passing)

### Schema Details
The globalChains table includes:
- chainId (number) - unique identifier for the blockchain
- name (string) - human-readable chain name
- rpcUrls (array of strings) - RPC endpoint URLs
- explorerUrl (optional string) - block explorer URL
- nativeCurrency (object: name, symbol, decimals) - native token info
- isTestnet (boolean) - whether this is a test network
- isEnabled (boolean) - whether the chain is active
- priority (number) - display/selection priority
- createdAt, updatedAt (numbers) - timestamps

Indexes: by_chain_id, by_enabled

### Notes for Next Developer
1. The test suite has no actual test files (only node_modules tests), so `npm run test` fails. This is a pre-existing issue.
2. Use `bun run build` to verify TypeScript compilation.
3. Next priority: Implement "Create organizationChains table schema" to allow organizations to override chain settings.
4. The platform schema directory is now set up - additional platform tables (platformConfig, featureFlags, organizationFeatureOverrides) should be added there.
